      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p1>
        Hello! My name is [name], and I am a freshman in high school with a passion for music, programming, and math. I've been programming in Python for 4 years and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for over a year. For the last 5 months, I've been working on a discord bot I programmed
        called slyer-bot, which I started on May 28th of 2024 and have kept updating since! This has increased my knowledge of Node.js and JavaScript in general as well. As for music, I've been playing piano for seven years and clarinet for three, composing 
        short pieces for concert bands/marching bands in my free time as well.
